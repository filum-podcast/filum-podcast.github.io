As global anxiety rates continue to climb, scientific research points to a growing mental health crisis shaped by social, environmental, and personal pressures. In this episode, we observe the root causes behind this surge, from digital overwhelm to isolation and uncertainty. We also explore a gentle, restorative response: the healing potential of thread and fibre.

The story features the inspiring work of textile artist Claire Wellesley-Smith and her slow stitching and creative textile practices that serve as powerful tools for emotional healing, leading anxious souls with care and quiet persistence.

Textile artists demonstrate how mindful stitching can offer emotional grounding, especially for those navigating trauma and stress. It helps them to consider fabric as a space for reflection, repair, and renewal. Why not join this voyage of discovery!?
Tune in for a conversation that weaves together science, creativity, and the quiet resilience of the human spirit to rediscover balance, presence, and joy stitch by stitch.
