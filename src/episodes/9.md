In this episode, we dive into the fascinating interplay of the five human senses – sight, touch, smell, hearing, and even taste – through the lenses of physiology, psychology and fashion. While fashion is traditionally seen as a visually dominant field, we challenge that perception by exploring how all the senses contribute to the experience of clothing, identity, and emotional resonance.

Our conversation moves into the world of inclusive design, focusing on the growing movement of “blind fashion” – where fashion brands create garments specifically with and for people with visual impairments, relying on texture, comfort and functionality.
These designs allow non-visual senses to take the lead in the aesthetic and practical experience of clothing, when touch becomes storytelling and texture conveys mood.

Sensory design offers not only inclusion but innovation that contributes to the lives of disabled people and ordinary humans, making them more aware of other individuals they live side by side.
Enjoy this story about human perception, adaptive creativity, and the power of design to embrace all bodies and ways of sensing the world.
