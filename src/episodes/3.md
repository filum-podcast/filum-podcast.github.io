In this episode, we unravel the powerful connection between chaos and creativity, exploring how artistic expression often begins in the unknown. Through the lens of mixed media and textile art, we dive into the messy, intuitive, and deeply emotional process of making — where fibres found objects and personal histories converge.

At the heart of our conversation is the extraordinary legacy of Judith Scott, a self-taught artist whose wrapped and cocooned sculptures became icons of outsider art. Her work, created in silence and instinct, speaks volumes about identity, transformation, and the healing potential of touch and texture.

We reflect on the role of experimentation in textile art, the beauty of non-verbal storytelling, and the profound truth that art need not follow rules to be deeply meaningful. Join us as we celebrate the boldness of making without a map, and the enduring power of fiber to hold both: chaos and grace.
