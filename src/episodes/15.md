In this episode, we explore a rarely celebrated yet deeply human part of the creative journey: the pause that occurs in the lives of artists, writers, and thinkers who often face dormant periods in their practice, dealing with gaps in their CVs that are too often viewed as failures or weaknesses.
But what if those silent spaces hold creative and emotional power?

From the emotional unease of personal crises to the turbulence of war and social upheaval, we examine the many reasons behind creative dormancy – and how comparison culture can deepen the shame around it. Through the stories of Lenore Tawney, Ewa Kuryluk, Aisha Khalid, and others, we reflect on how intentional pauses can become acts of resistance, reflection, and profound transformation.

Whether you're navigating your own quiet season or simply curious about the unseen sides of artistic life, this episode offers insight into how stillness can fuel resurgence – and how every creative path unfolds in its own time.
