In this episode, we explore the philosophical and psychological dimensions of space – not as empty distance, but as a field of experience. Through the quiet, contemplative work of art, we look at how paper, textile and thread can transform our perception of space into something internal, emotional, and deeply grounding.

We imagine the art pieces of Agnes Martin – the subtle grids and soft palettes that evoke a feeling of a space not to be filled, but to be sensed – inviting presence, silence, and clarity.

Blending ideas from philosophy, psychology, and visual culture, this episode reflects on the importance of feeling ourselves here – fully present in this space, in this moment, and how art can guide us back to that awareness.
A gentle meditation on space as something you don't just occupy – but feel.
