In this reflective episode, we explore the powerful phenomenon of the inner voice — that ever-present dialogue shaping how artists see themselves, their work, and the world around them. We will observe how this internal monologue can fuel creativity and spiral into self-doubt and relentless criticism.

We will discover the key ways to tame it, drawing on the emotional honesty of Louise Bourgeois, who famously channelled her traumatic experience and self-critique into utterly personal, psychological art. We discuss how artists can face and even befriend their inner critic. Through storytelling, psychology, and lived experiences, this talk invites listeners to examine how the inner voice impacts artistic identity, emotional health, and the courage to keep creating.

Whether you whisper to yourself in the studio or wrestle with inner judgment, this episode is a gentle companion on the path of self-expression.
