In this episode, we journey into the dreams that begin in childhood — those vast, shining hopes of becoming an astronaut — and how they intertwine with the quiet, grounded rhythm of handcraft. What happens when these two worlds meet?

We explore the inspiring story of those who carried their love for making into the cosmos, including astronaut Karen Nyberg, who stitched a starry quilt block aboard the International Space Station, and artists like Ebru Kurbak, who reimagine textile traditions in microgravity.

This talk reflects on how creativity survives and adapts beyond Earth, how the dream of spaceflight is not only scientific but poetic, and how art, like space, offers infinite potential. Tune in to reflect, imagine, and discover the delicate threads that connect stardust to stitchwork.
