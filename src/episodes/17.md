In this episode, we explore the ethical and cultural challenges of living with artificial intelligence and large language models – tools that, much like the machines of the early 20th century, are reshaping how we think, work, and create.

Drawing parallels to the industrial revolution, we revisit figures like William Morris, who resisted mass production in defense of craftsmanship, and Karl Marx, who critiqued the alienation brought by mechanization.

We also reflect on Aldous Huxley’s warnings from the 1950s, where he urged us to treat technology wisely, lest it begin to dominate rather than serve us. Together, these voices frame a timely question: can we direct AI to enrich human life and creativity, rather than diminish them?
