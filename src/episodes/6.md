In this episode, we explore the deep emotional experience of losing a sense of belonging — especially for those who’ve lived under harsh or repressive regimes. When one’s homeland becomes a place of silence, fear, or disconnection, how do we begin to reclaim a sense of identity and home?

We turn to fibre art as a healing language — a tactile, expressive practice that speaks across borders and brings people together through shared human values. Embroidery, quilting, sewing and other types of textile art are quiet forms of resistance and powerful tools for reconnection.

Discover how textile artists have stitched their way into a global community, rediscovering the self, and easing emotional wounds through creativity. They featured personal stories through the gentle touch of fabric and thread.
