What happens when gladiators leave the ring behind — not in defeat, but in search of something deeper? In this episode, we explore the radical career shifts of boxing legends who transformed their lives through creativity, craftsmanship, and inner reflection.

We look into the powerful stories of Sammy Frager, the featherweight champion who turned to glove-making with monastic precision; Muhammad Ali, whose late-life journey into visual art became a form of spiritual therapy; and Mark Connor, a lesser-known fighter who found peace in poetry and crafts after the bell.

Listen to their stories and unpack the psychological weight of career transformation, the courage it takes to start anew, and the human longing for meaning beyond success. This episode is about more than boxing – it’s about the fight to become whole.
